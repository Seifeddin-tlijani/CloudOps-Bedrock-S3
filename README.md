### Description

- **Users**: Send HTTP requests via API Gateway.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for the application, routing user requests to the AWS Lambda function.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes the requests, interacts with Amazon Bedrock for AI/ML functionalities, and stores or retrieves data from Amazon S3 as required.
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Provides AI/ML model capabilities to enhance the applicationâ€™s functionality.
- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing and retrieving data required by the application.
